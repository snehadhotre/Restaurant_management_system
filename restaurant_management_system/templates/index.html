      <h2>About Restaurant Management System</h2>
      <p>Restaurant Management System are used to track and monitor when products start and stop work. A time and Payroll system provides many benefits to organizations as it enables an employer to have full control of their products working hours as it monitors late arrivals, early departures, time taken on breaks and absenteeism [1]. It also helps to control labor costs by reducing over-payments, which are often caused by paying products for time that are not working, and eliminates transcription error, interpretation error and intentional error. TNA systems are also invaluable for ensuring compliance with labor regulations regarding proof of Payroll. All of these benefits provide both employer and products with confidence in the accuracy of their wage payments all while improving productivity.</p>
      <p>Traditionally manual systems were used that rely on highly skilled people laboriously adding up paper cards which have times stamped onto them using a time stamping machine such as the Bundy Clock. Time stamping machines were used for over a century but have since been phased out and replaced with cheaper automated systems which eliminate the need for payroll staff to manually input product hours.</p>
